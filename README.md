DriverPass realised that there is not a very good drivers ed system.. So they wanted to have the company map out the creation and how their software would work.  They wanted a system that was able to be accessed via phone and internet with a cloud storage system.
I feel that I did pretty well on my charts for explaining the order of operations on a baseline level.
I would pick the schedule.  That is beecasue it is ugly to me, I was unable to get the software to work properly for me so I had to make in excell.
I feel that I interpretted what they wanted how they wanted it,  I thikn that their needs are almost the most importnt thing because they will be the ones using it.
I design software mainly by just thinking of loops and if or statements and try to design the trail.
